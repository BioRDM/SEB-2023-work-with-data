## Content


The way we disseminate scientific results is changing to include Open Science and Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) principles. Well-organised data (and code) is not just the best preparation for this, it can also increase productivity. With the introduction of Narrative CVs, both your research and you can be recognised for these new research outputs. We aim to show how you can make the most of these changes by thinking ahead about your data.

In this interactive, two-parts session, we will teach:
-	the benefits of Open Science
-	the principles of FAIR data  and what they mean in practice
-	what the metadata is and how to describe your data to make them re-usable
-	how to organize your data in files and tables
-	what resources are available to assist in data management

This workshop is aimed at all active researchers in biomedical sciences: PhD students, postdocs, technicians and even PIs.
